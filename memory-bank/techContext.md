# Technical Context: Sleep Pattern Tracking Application

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Next.js
- **UI Library**: Material UI (MUI)
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Data Storage**: Local Storage (initial phase) with potential migration to a lightweight database
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux Toolkit
- **Charting Library**: Recharts or Chart.js for data visualization

## Development Setup
1. Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript and Material UI.
2. Implement a responsive layout and navigation.
3. Use Local Storage for initial data persistence.
4. Develop visualization components using Recharts or Chart.js.
5. Ensure proper date/time handling across timezones.

## Technical Constraints
- Data is stored locally in the browser during the initial phase.
- The application must handle date/time data consistently across timezones.
- Future enhancements should be designed with Apple Health integration in mind.
- Offline functionality is required for reliable data entry.

## Dependencies
- React
- Next.js
- Material UI
- TypeScript
- Recharts or Chart.js (for data visualization)

## Future Considerations
- Migration to a lightweight database (e.g., IndexedDB, SQLite, or serverless options).
- Integration with Apple Health for automatic sleep data import.
- Export functionality for data backup.
- Dark mode for nighttime use.
