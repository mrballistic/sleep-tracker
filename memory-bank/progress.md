# Progress: Sleep Pattern Tracking Application

## Current Status
The foundational Memory Bank for the Sleep Pattern Tracking Application has been established. Key project contexts, including goals, technical details, system patterns, and product vision, have been documented.

## Completed Work
1. Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's core requirements, goals, scope, and deliverables.
2. Created `techContext.md` to outline the technology stack, development setup, constraints, dependencies, and future considerations.
3. Created `systemPatterns.md` to document the application's architecture, data flow, design patterns, and component relationships.
4. Created `productContext.md` to capture the purpose, problems solved, user experience goals, key features, and future vision.
5. Created `activeContext.md` to track the current focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions.
6. Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Material UI integration.
7. Implemented automatic dark mode support based on system preferences.
8. Created basic page structure for all main views (entry, weekly, monthly, settings).
