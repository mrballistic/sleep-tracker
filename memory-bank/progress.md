# Progress: Sleep Pattern Tracking Application

## Current Status
The foundational Memory Bank for the Sleep Pattern Tracking Application has been established. Key project contexts, including goals, technical details, system patterns, and product vision, have been documented.

## Completed Work
1. Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's core requirements, goals, scope, and deliverables.
2. Created `techContext.md` to outline the technology stack, development setup, constraints, dependencies, and future considerations.
3. Created `systemPatterns.md` to document the application's architecture, data flow, design patterns, and component relationships.
4. Created `productContext.md` to capture the purpose, problems solved, user experience goals, key features, and future vision.
5. Created `activeContext.md` to track the current focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions.

## Remaining Tasks
1. Begin implementation of the application's core features:
   - Develop the sleep entry form with validation.
   - Implement Local Storage service for data persistence.
   - Create visualization components for weekly and monthly views.
2. Design and implement the dashboard with summary statistics and recent entries.
3. Add edit/delete functionality for sleep entries.
4. Polish the UI/UX with responsive design and Material UI components.
5. Plan for future enhancements, including Apple Health integration and database migration.

## Known Issues
- None identified at this stage. Potential challenges include:
  - Ensuring proper date/time handling across timezones.
  - Validating data entry to prevent inconsistencies.
  - Maintaining responsive design across devices.

## Next Milestones
1. Complete the sleep entry form and Local Storage service.
2. Develop the weekly and monthly visualization components.
