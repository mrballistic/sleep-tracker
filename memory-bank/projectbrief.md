# Project Brief: Sleep Pattern Tracking Application

## Core Requirements
The Sleep Pattern Tracking Application is a single-user tool designed to allow users to manually enter sleep data and visualize patterns over time. The application will initially store data locally and provide features for tracking and analyzing sleep habits. Future enhancements include integration with Apple Health and migration to a lightweight database.

## Goals
1. Provide an intuitive interface for users to log sleep data.
2. Offer visualizations to help users identify sleep patterns and trends.
3. Ensure data is stored reliably and can be expanded for future enhancements.
4. Design the application to be lightweight, responsive, and user-friendly.

## Scope
The project will focus on:
- Building a client-side application using React, Next.js, and TypeScript.
- Implementing core features such as sleep entry, data visualization, and statistics.
- Using Local Storage for data persistence in the initial phase.
- Designing the architecture to accommodate future integrations and enhancements.

## Deliverables
1. A functional sleep tracking application with:
   - Sleep entry form
   - Weekly and monthly visualizations
   - Statistics panel
   - Local Storage-based data persistence
2. Documentation for future enhancements and technical considerations.
