# System Patterns: Sleep Pattern Tracking Application

## Application Architecture

### Pages
- `/`: Dashboard with summary statistics and recent entries
- `/entry`: Sleep entry form
- `/weekly`: Weekly sleep pattern visualization
- `/monthly`: Monthly sleep pattern visualization
- `/settings`: Application settings (theme, future Apple Health integration)

### Components
- `SleepEntryForm`: Form for adding/editing sleep data
- `WeeklyChart`: Component for weekly sleep visualization
- `MonthlyCalendar`: Heat map calendar for monthly view
- `StatisticsPanel`: Summary of sleep metrics
- `EntryList`: List of recent sleep entries with edit/delete functionality

## Data Flow
1. User inputs sleep data via the entry form.
2. Data is validated and processed (calculating duration, etc.).
3. Entry is stored in Local Storage.
4. Dashboard and visualizations read from Local Storage to display patterns.

## Design Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular React components for reusability and maintainability.
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux Toolkit for managing application state.
- **Data Persistence**: Local Storage for initial implementation, with future migration to a database.
- **Visualization**: Use of charting libraries (Recharts or Chart.js) for graphical representation of data.

## Relationships
- `SleepEntryForm` interacts with Local Storage to save and retrieve data.
- `WeeklyChart` and `MonthlyCalendar` read data from Local Storage for visualization.
- `StatisticsPanel` calculates metrics based on stored data.
- `EntryList` provides functionality for editing and deleting entries.

## Future Enhancements
- Apple Health integration for automatic sleep data import.
- Migration to a lightweight database for improved scalability.
- Advanced analytics for sleep trend analysis and recommendations.
- Export functionality for data backup.
