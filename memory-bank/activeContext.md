# Active Context: Sleep Pattern Tracking Application

## Current Focus
The focus has shifted from documentation to implementation. The project structure is established with Next.js, TypeScript, and Material UI, and we're ready to begin developing core features.

## Recent Changes
1. Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Material UI integration
2. Implemented automatic dark mode support using system preferences
3. Created basic page structure for all main views:
   - Entry form
   - Weekly visualization
   - Monthly visualization
   - Settings
4. Added project documentation:
   - Comprehensive README with emoji-enhanced sections
   - MIT license
   - .gitignore configuration

## Next Steps
1. Implement the sleep entry form with validation
2. Set up Local Storage service for data persistence
3. Add navigation between pages
4. Begin work on visualization components

## Active Decisions
- Using Material UI's ThemeProvider with system preference-based dark mode
- Implementing client-side components with 'use client' directive
- Following Next.js 13+ app directory structure
- Using TypeScript for type safety

## Considerations
- Ensure proper date/time handling across timezones.
- Validate data entry to prevent inconsistencies.
- Focus on responsive design for usability across devices.
