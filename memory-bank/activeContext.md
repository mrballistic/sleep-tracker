# Active Context: Sleep Pattern Tracking Application

## Current Focus
The immediate focus is on establishing the foundational structure of the Memory Bank for the Sleep Pattern Tracking Application. This includes documenting the project's goals, technical context, system patterns, and product context based on the provided technical brief.

## Recent Changes
1. Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's core requirements, goals, scope, and deliverables.
2. Created `techContext.md` to outline the technology stack, development setup, constraints, dependencies, and future considerations.
3. Created `systemPatterns.md` to document the application's architecture, data flow, design patterns, and component relationships.
4. Created `productContext.md` to capture the purpose, problems solved, user experience goals, key features, and future vision.

## Next Steps
1. Develop `progress.md` to track the current status, completed work, and remaining tasks.
2. Review all Memory Bank files to ensure completeness and alignment with the technical brief.
3. Begin implementation of the application's core features, starting with the sleep entry form and Local Storage service.

## Active Decisions
- Use Local Storage for initial data persistence.
- Implement visualization components using Recharts or Chart.js.
- Design the application with future Apple Health integration in mind.

## Considerations
- Ensure proper date/time handling across timezones.
- Validate data entry to prevent inconsistencies.
- Focus on responsive design for usability across devices.
