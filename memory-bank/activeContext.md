# Active Context: Sleep Pattern Tracking Application

## Current Focus
Implementation of core visualization features is underway. The weekly sleep pattern visualization has been completed with a responsive chart and detailed metrics display.

## Recent Changes
1. Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Material UI integration
2. Implemented automatic dark mode support using system preferences
3. Created basic page structure for all main views:
   - Entry form
   - Weekly visualization
   - Monthly visualization
   - Settings
4. Added project documentation:
   - Comprehensive README with emoji-enhanced sections
   - MIT license
   - .gitignore configuration
5. Implemented weekly visualization component:
   - Bar chart showing average sleep duration
   - Weekly summary cards with sleep metrics
   - Interactive tooltips with detailed statistics
   - Responsive layout using Material UI
   - Integration with Local Storage service

## Next Steps
1. Implement the sleep entry form with validation
2. Create the monthly visualization component
3. Add navigation between pages
4. Begin work on the dashboard with summary statistics

## Active Decisions
- Using Material UI's ThemeProvider with system preference-based dark mode
- Implementing client-side components with 'use client' directive
- Following Next.js 13+ app directory structure
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Using Recharts for data visualization
- Implementing responsive design patterns for all components

## Considerations
- Ensure proper date/time handling across timezones
- Validate data entry to prevent inconsistencies
- Focus on responsive design for usability across devices
- Maintain consistent UI patterns across visualization components
